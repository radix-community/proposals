## Abstract

This specification defines an off-ledger, machine readable metadata file that provides optional, supplemental data to a registered Validator Node's on-ledger data.

## Motivation

The current on-ledger data that can be set for a registered Radix Validator Node is a `name` field and an `url` field. The `url` field can be any valid URL of scheme type `https`, `http`, `ftp`, `ftps`, `telnet`, `gopher`, `mailto`, and `news`. As a user, you are required to browse each Validator url in order to find out more information about a Node and its Operator.

This specification defines an optional, machine readable, metadata file that is stored off-ledger. The metadata file is linked back to the Validator node by constructing a well-known URL path that is created from the Validator Node's registered, on-ledger, `url` field.

The metadata file and its contents are optional but may be used by services such as Wallets and Explorers to enrich the data they collect about Validator Nodes.

The specification proposes some standard fields to include in the metadata file but it is up to the consumer of the data to decide how to process and use the data contained therein.

## Metadata File Location

The location of the metadata file MUST be determined by the URL defined in the on-ledger `url` field of the registered Validator Node. This requirement ensures that the off-ledger metadata file is linked back to the registered on-ledger data.

Using the [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) : Generic Syntax](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html) RFC terminology, the url location of the metadata files MUST be determined by the `scheme` and `authority` of the registered `url` value only.

```
         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
```

The `scheme` of the registered `url` for a validator MUST be either `http` or `https`. This requirement is because the `url` field may use several alternative schemes that do not support metadata discovery using a well known path.


It is recommended that the scheme SHOULD be `https` in order to prevent the metadata file data from being altered with a [Man-in-the-Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) by an intermediary.

A path of `/.well-known/radix-meta.json` MUST be appended to the `scheme` and `authority` of the `url` to create the full URL to the metadata file.

### Examples

| Validator Url                                         | Metadata File path                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `https://example.com`                                 | `https://example.com/.well-known/radix-meta.json`      |
| `http://www.example.com/validators/mynode/index.html` | `http://www.example.com/.well-known/radix-meta.json`   |
| `https://example.com:4443?node=mynode#info`           | `https://example.com:4443/.well-known/radix-meta.json` |
| `https://user:pw@example.com`                         | `https://example.com/.well-known/radix-meta.json`      |
| `ftps://example.com/data/info.json`                   | none                                                   |


## Metadata File Contents

The contents of the metadata file `radix-meta.json` MUST be a valid `JSON` formatted document. An empty or invalid file MUST be ignored.

The file SHOULD contain ONE or MORE `keyword:value` pairs. A valid file consisting of only `{}` is a valid, but useless metadata file.

All `keyword:value` pairs SHOULD be optional. There are no mandatory, required fields that must be specified in the metadata file.

Any unrecognised, non-standard keywords in the metadata SHOULD be silently ignored. Metadata parsers should follow the [Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) - that is, accept the addition of new fields and values without failing.


## Metadata Standard Keywords

It is useful to define some initial standardised keywords in the Metadata file that are immediately useful to enrich a list of registered Validators. For example, such a list may appear in a Wallet when displaying a list of candidate Validator Nodes to consider for staking purposes.

### `summary` :

A short, descriptive summary about the Node Operator intended to be displayed on 1 line.

The `summary` field SHOULD support UTF-8 encoding with a maximum length of 255 characters.

### `description` :

A longer description about the Node Operator intended to add further details that don't fit in the summary.

The `description` field SHOULD support UTF-8 encoding with a maximum length of ???? characters.


### `country_iso2` :

A 2 letter country code as defined in [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)

The `country_iso2` MAY be used by a Node Operator to indicate their geographic location. For example, as Swiss based Node Operator may run Validator Nodes in data centres in New York, London, and Seoul. They would specify a `country_iso2` code of `CH` to identify Switzerland as the geographical location of their operations.

### `media_assets` :

`icon_png_url` :

A square image file that represents the Node Operator and is intended to be used as an icon or avatar.

The image file MUST be in a PNG format with a maximum dimension of 192x192px. The format and dimension were chosed to match the maximum size and type of an Android High Resolution icon. For comparison, the current maximum size and format of the Apple Touch icon is a 180x180px PNG file.

The image file size MUST NOT exceed 50 Kb in size. The file size restriction is imposed as the image file is intended to be displayed "as is" without any further resizing, scaling, or other processing required.

The image file SHOULD NOT be animated. Parsers SHOULD reject animated image files to avoid distractive images when displayed in a list.

The image url MAY be located at an url that does not match the host of the Metadata file. This is to allow external icons such as [Gravatars](https://en.gravatar.com/) to be used.

### `contact` :

The `contact` group MAY contain ONE or MORE contact methods that a Node Operator can be contacted on.

The `language_iso2` field MAY contain a `;` delimited list of 2 letter language codes defined by [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) that the Node Operator is able to support. If multiple languages are supported then they SHOULD be listed in order of preference/fluency.

The `primary` contact field MAY be used to indicate which of the provided contact methods is preferred.

### `nodes` :

The primary purpose of the `nodes` group is to associate related Radix Nodes to a Node Operator.

The `nodes` group SHOULD contain a list of ONE or MORE nodes identified by their Radix Node Address in the `address` field.

The `role` field MAY be used to describe one of the following 3 roles:

| role        | description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `full`      | A Full Node that is not registered as a Validator Node |
| `validator` | A Registered Validator Node                            |
| `archive`   | An Archive Node that provides an RPC endpoint          |

Note that we do not currently include node details such as location, hardware specifications and hosting provider details because they may change when a Validator Node is moved to a Standby/Backup server. The `radix-meta.json` file is intended to be a relatively static, reference data file that changes infrequently. Instead we can dynamically infer location and hosting provider from the current IP address of a node.

### `legal_entity` :

The `legal_entity` group MAY be used for providing details of the Legal Entity (Company or Individual) acting as the Node Operator.

The `name` and `address` fields are self explanatory and do not have a prescribed format due to the differences in representation in different countries.

The `country_iso2` field is a 2 letter country code defined by [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).

The `entity_id` field MAY be used for the country specific legal entity identifier code - For example, a UK Company Number, an Australian Business Number (ABN), a DUNS registration number, and so on.
